# Case Management

:::warning Content Under Review

:::

Organize related jobs into cases for better workflow management. Track case progress, manage escalations, and maintain customer context.

## Overview

Case Management allows you to group related jobs together into logical cases, providing better organization and context preservation across multiple interactions. Cases are particularly useful for customer support scenarios, complex projects, or any situation where multiple related tasks need to be coordinated and tracked together.

## Case Organization

### What is a Case?

A case is a container that groups related jobs and maintains context across multiple interactions. Think of it as a "ticket" or "project" that can contain multiple individual tasks or conversations.

**Examples of cases:**

- Customer support ticket with multiple follow-up interactions
- Product implementation project with various tasks
- Bug investigation with multiple analysis jobs
- Feature request with design and development jobs

### Case Structure

Each case contains:

- **Case Information**: Basic details, priority, and status
- **Related Jobs**: All jobs associated with the case
- **Customer Context**: Information about the customer or project
- **Communication History**: Timeline of all interactions
- **Escalation Path**: Rules for handling complex situations

## Creating and Managing Cases

### Case Creation

Create a new case when you need to:

- Handle a customer inquiry that may require multiple interactions
- Manage a project with multiple related tasks
- Track a complex issue that needs investigation
- Coordinate work across multiple agents or teams

**Case creation process:**

1. Navigate to **Cases** â†’ **Create New Case**
2. Fill in case details (title, description, priority)
3. Assign case owner and team members
4. Set escalation rules and notification preferences
5. Link to existing customer or project information

### Case Assignment

Assign cases to appropriate team members:

- **Case Owner**: Primary person responsible for case resolution
- **Team Members**: Additional staff who can work on the case
- **Escalation Contacts**: People to notify for complex issues
- **Stakeholders**: People who need visibility into case progress

### Case Status Management

Track case progress through different statuses:

- **Open**: Case is active and being worked on
- **In Progress**: Work is actively happening on the case
- **Waiting**: Case is waiting for customer response or external input
- **Escalated**: Case has been escalated for additional support
- **Resolved**: Case has been completed successfully
- **Closed**: Case is fully resolved and archived

## Case Context and Information

### Customer Context

Maintain comprehensive customer information:

- **Customer Profile**: Account details, preferences, and history
- **Previous Interactions**: History of support requests and resolutions
- **Product Usage**: Current subscriptions and feature utilization
- **Communication Preferences**: Preferred contact methods and times

### Business Context

Include relevant business information:

- **Account Type**: Customer tier and service level
- **Contract Details**: Service agreements and commitments
- **Billing Information**: Payment history and current status
- **Business Impact**: Priority based on customer value

### Technical Context

Preserve technical details:

- **System Environment**: Technical specifications and configurations
- **Previous Issues**: Related problems and their resolutions
- **Integration Details**: Connected systems and dependencies
- **Performance Metrics**: Historical system performance data

## Case Workflow Management

### Job Organization

Organize jobs within cases:

- **Primary Job**: Main task or interaction for the case
- **Follow-up Jobs**: Additional tasks needed for resolution
- **Escalation Jobs**: Tasks assigned to specialized agents
- **Validation Jobs**: Quality checks and confirmations

### Escalation Management

Handle complex cases that need additional support:

**Escalation Triggers:**

- Technical complexity beyond agent capabilities
- Customer dissatisfaction or complaints
- Time-sensitive issues requiring immediate attention
- Business impact requiring management review

**Escalation Process:**

1. Identify escalation need based on triggers
2. Route case to appropriate escalation contact
3. Notify stakeholders of escalation
4. Track escalation progress and resolution
5. Document escalation outcomes and learnings

### Communication Tracking

Maintain complete communication history:

- **Interaction Log**: All conversations and interactions
- **Decision Points**: Key decisions made during case resolution
- **Action Items**: Tasks assigned and their completion status
- **Follow-up Requirements**: Future actions needed

## Case Analytics and Reporting

### Performance Metrics

Track case effectiveness:

- **Resolution Time**: Time from case creation to resolution
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Satisfaction scores for case outcomes
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of cases requiring escalation
- **First Contact Resolution**: Cases resolved in initial interaction

### Case Volume Analysis

Understand case patterns:

- **Case Distribution**: Types and categories of cases
- **Seasonal Trends**: Patterns in case volume over time
- **Agent Workload**: Distribution of cases across team members
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of case handling

### Quality Metrics

Measure case quality:

- **Resolution Quality**: Effectiveness of case resolutions
- **Customer Experience**: Overall satisfaction with case handling
- **Process Efficiency**: Speed and efficiency of case workflows
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning and improvement over time

## Case Management Best Practices

### Case Organization

- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent case titles
- **Proper Categorization**: Assign appropriate case types and tags
- **Customer Linking**: Connect cases to customer profiles
- **Related Case Linking**: Connect related cases when appropriate

### Context Preservation

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Record all relevant information
- **Customer History**: Maintain complete interaction history
- **Technical Details**: Preserve technical context and specifications
- **Business Impact**: Document business significance and priorities

### Escalation Management

- **Clear Triggers**: Define specific escalation criteria
- **Escalation Path**: Establish clear escalation procedures
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Keep relevant parties informed
- **Escalation Tracking**: Monitor escalation progress and outcomes

### Continuous Improvement

- **Case Reviews**: Regularly review case outcomes and processes
- **Process Optimization**: Identify and implement workflow improvements
- **Agent Training**: Use case learnings to improve agent performance
- **Customer Feedback**: Incorporate customer input into process improvements

## Advanced Case Features

### Case Templates

Use predefined templates for common case types:

- **Support Request**: Standard customer support case structure
- **Bug Report**: Technical issue investigation template
- **Feature Request**: Product enhancement request workflow
- **Account Management**: Customer account modification process

### Automated Case Routing

Implement intelligent case assignment:

- **Skill-based Routing**: Match cases to agents with appropriate skills
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute cases evenly across team members
- **Priority-based Assignment**: Route high-priority cases to senior staff
- **Customer Preference**: Respect customer's preferred agent assignments

### Case Collaboration

Enable team collaboration on complex cases:

- **Shared Case Access**: Allow multiple team members to work on cases
- **Internal Notes**: Share information and updates with team
- **Case Handoffs**: Smoothly transfer cases between team members
- **Collaborative Resolution**: Work together on case solutions
