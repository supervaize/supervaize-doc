Enhance mission execution with business rules, knowledge base links, and operational constraints. Provide agents with the context they need for optimal performance.

## Overview

Context Management allows you to provide AI agents with the business knowledge, rules, and constraints they need to perform effectively. By adding context to your missions, you ensure that agents understand your business processes, customer expectations, and operational guidelines.

### Step 1: Access Mission Dashboard

Navigate to **Missions** â†’ **Your Mission Name** to view the mission overview and access context configuration options.

### Step 2: Add Context (Optional)

Enhance mission execution with additional context using the context configuration panel:

- **Business Rules**: Define escalation triggers and response templates
- **Knowledge Base**: Link to FAQ, product docs, and training materials
- **Constraints**: Set working hours, holidays, and response time limits

## Context Configuration Options

### Business Rules

Define the operational guidelines that agents should follow:

#### Escalation Triggers

Configure when to escalate issues to human agents:

- **Urgent Requests**: High-priority customer inquiries
- **Complex Issues**: Technical problems requiring expertise
- **Complaints**: Customer dissatisfaction or complaints
- **Billing Issues**: Payment or subscription problems
- **Security Concerns**: Potential security or privacy issues

#### Response Templates

Provide standardized response formats:

- **Greeting Templates**: Professional and consistent introductions
- **Escalation Messages**: Clear communication about next steps
- **Resolution Confirmations**: Acknowledgment of completed tasks
- **Follow-up Instructions**: Guidance for customer actions

### Knowledge Base Integration

Connect agents to your existing knowledge resources:

#### FAQ Integration

- **FAQ URL**: Link to your help center or knowledge base
- **Search Capabilities**: Enable agents to search for relevant information
- **Category Organization**: Organize information by topic or function
- **Update Frequency**: Ensure information is current and accurate

#### Product Documentation

- **Product Manuals**: Technical specifications and user guides
- **Feature Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of product capabilities
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common problems and solutions
- **Video Tutorials**: Visual learning resources

#### Training Materials

- **Agent Training**: Specific instructions for your agents
- **Process Documentation**: Step-by-step operational procedures
- **Best Practices**: Proven methods for optimal performance
- **Case Studies**: Examples of successful interactions

### Operational Constraints

Set boundaries and limitations for agent operations:

#### Time-based Constraints

- **Working Hours**: Define when agents are available
- **Holiday Schedule**: Specify dates when agents are unavailable
- **Response Time Limits**: Set maximum acceptable response times
- **Escalation Timeframes**: Define when to escalate time-sensitive issues

#### Business Constraints

- **Service Level Agreements**: Commit to specific response times
- **Quality Standards**: Minimum acceptable quality thresholds
- **Cost Limits**: Maximum acceptable costs per interaction
- **Resource Availability**: Limits on concurrent operations

## Context Types and Categories

### Customer Context

Provide agents with customer-specific information:

- **Customer Profile**: Account type, preferences, and history
- **Interaction History**: Previous conversations and resolutions
- **Product Usage**: Current subscriptions and feature usage
- **Support Tickets**: Open and resolved support requests

### Business Context

Share current business information:

- **Promotions**: Active sales and special offers
- **Product Updates**: Recent releases and new features
- **Company News**: Important announcements and changes
- **Market Conditions**: Industry trends and competitive information

### Technical Context

Include technical specifications and capabilities:

- **System Status**: Current system performance and availability
- **Integration Details**: Connected services and APIs
- **Performance Metrics**: System response times and reliability
- **Known Issues**: Current problems and workarounds

## Context Management Best Practices

### Information Organization

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organize information by importance and relevance
- **Tagging System**: Use consistent tags for easy searching
- **Version Control**: Track changes and updates to context information
- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive information

### Content Quality

- **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is current and correct
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language that agents can understand
- **Completeness**: Provide comprehensive coverage of relevant topics
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting

### Maintenance and Updates

- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of context information
- **Update Process**: Establish clear procedures for updating content
- **Validation**: Verify accuracy of new or updated information
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect agent feedback on context usefulness

## Context Impact on Agent Performance

### Improved Accuracy

- **Better Understanding**: Agents have more complete information
- **Reduced Errors**: Fewer mistakes due to missing context
- **Appropriate Responses**: More relevant and helpful answers
- **Consistent Behavior**: Uniform responses across similar situations

### Enhanced Efficiency

- **Faster Resolution**: Agents can resolve issues more quickly
- **Fewer Escalations**: More problems resolved without human intervention
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Optimal use of agent capabilities
- **Improved Customer Satisfaction**: Higher quality interactions

### Operational Benefits

- **Standardized Processes**: Consistent handling of similar situations
- **Better Training**: Agents learn from comprehensive context
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: Clear guidelines for problem resolution
- **Scalable Operations**: Context can be shared across multiple agents

## Troubleshooting Context Issues

### Missing Information

**Common causes:**

- Incomplete context configuration
- Outdated information
- Poor organization of content
- Access restrictions

**Solutions:**

- Review and complete context setup
- Update outdated information
- Reorganize content structure
- Adjust access permissions

### Conflicting Information

**Common causes:**

- Multiple sources with different information
- Outdated context not removed
- Inconsistent updates across sources
- Poor coordination between teams

**Solutions:**

- Establish single source of truth
- Implement regular cleanup procedures
- Coordinate updates across teams
- Validate information consistency

### Performance Issues

**Common causes:**

- Too much context overwhelming agents
- Irrelevant information slowing responses
- Poor search and retrieval mechanisms
- Inefficient context organization

**Solutions:**

- Prioritize essential context
- Remove irrelevant information
- Improve search capabilities
- Optimize context structure

## Next Steps

After configuring context for your mission:

1. **Create jobs** to test context effectiveness
2. **Monitor agent performance** with the new context
3. **Refine context** based on performance feedback
4. **Expand context** to other missions as needed
