## Network access and firewall considerations

:::warning Avoid strict network access control

**Do not deploy agents behind strict network access control** (e.g. firewalls or security groups that allow only a fixed allowlist of IPs) unless you have explicitly allowed all Supervaize app IP addresses.

Agents must reach Supervaize services to register, receive work, and report status. If outbound traffic is restricted to a narrow allowlist, connections will fail and agents will not function correctly.

:::

### Allowing Supervaize app IP addresses

If your environment uses IP allowlisting (firewall rules, security groups, egress proxies, or similar), you must allow outbound traffic to the full set of IPs used by the Supervaize app.

**Full list of Supervaize app IP addresses:**

**[https://app.supervaize.com/network-access/](https://app.supervaize.com/network-access/)**

Use this page to obtain the current list of IP addresses and keep your allowlist updated when Supervaize publishes changes.

### Recommendations

- Prefer environments that allow outbound HTTPS to `*.supervaize.com` (or the specific hostnames your agent uses) rather than IP-based allowlists, when possible.
- If you must use IP allowlists, subscribe to or periodically refresh from the network-access page and automate updates where feasible.
- Test agent connectivity after any firewall or network policy change.
